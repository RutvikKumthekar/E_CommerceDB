In SQL , a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS 
SELECT column1, column2, …
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
